<h2>Golf Shooter</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
I don't know many golf games that make you shoot the balls into the hole like a top down shooter while the hole is moving back and forth.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
Not sure really. Things move and bullets do stuff when they collide.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
I learned how to make sprites and how to get bullets to shoot and collide. The hardest part was getting phaser to work.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
I used GIMP and drew all my images.
Golf ball sound is from <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAmxRBXZH84>here</a>.
</li>
<ul>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
I borrowed the bullet code from gamemechanincexplorer.com, but besides that I didn't look at/borrow from any phaser examples to my knowledge.
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Shoot golf balls into the moving hole to try and score 10 points as fast as possible.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Golfer
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
N/A
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
Shooting bullets
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
What it feels to shoot golf balls into a hole. Honestly, I wanted to make a bullet hell game but that's quite a bit of work and didn't have time this week.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
A player can move around the screen using the AD keys (A - Left, D - Right)
They can shoot by holding down Space.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Shooting ahead of where the hole moves and finding a place you're comfortable with.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
Just a person who likes to golf.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
People who like 2d shooting games.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
Around a minute or two.
</li>

</ul>
