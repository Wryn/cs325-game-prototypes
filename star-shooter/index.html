<h2>Star Shooter</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
To be honest, I was talking with someone else about this weeks project, and they were the one who came up with the searchlight idea. They said they weren't planning o using it though so I just took it as a go ahead. Also I reused assets from last week.

Limited Vision
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
I learned a little bit of how to use P2 physics.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
I used GIMP and drew all my images.
Crash sound from http://soundbible.com/1945-Smashing.html.
Bullet sound from http://soundbible.com/1087-Laser.html.
Impact sound from http://soundbible.com/538-Blast.html.

The player can look around using the mouse and fire a bullet in the direction of the mouse by clicking. Everytime you shoot the searchlight gets smaller.
</li>

Manage the speed at a level where you can still track the pointer. Or just go all out and bet on your reaction time.
</li>

Your ship is stranded in the midst of space with limited. Unseen debris is hurling at you at fast speeds. Using your search light, can you eliminate the debris before it eliminates you?
