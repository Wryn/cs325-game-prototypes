<h2>Chicken</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
I probably don't play enough variety of games, but as of right now I don't know any game of chicken that's similar
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
Scrolling screen and P2 Physics.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
I learned a little bit of how to use P2 physics.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
I used GIMP and drew all my images. Crash sound from http://soundbible.com/1945-Smashing.html.
</li>
<ul>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Does it count as borrowing from Phaser examples if I only checked to look at the usage of certain functions? If so, I looked at the P2 Polygon example along with the P2 movement example.
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
A minimalistic high speed game of Chicken.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Chicken
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
Keyboard, Achiever
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
Scrolling Camera
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Have players on the edge of their seat as they try their best to score as high as possible without running into the other arrow.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The player can speed up by holding the shift key and full stop with the spacebar. There's also a 20 second time limit, so you should try to go relatively fast.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Manage the speed at a level where you can still track the pointer. Or just go all out and bet on your reaction time.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
Can you prove you're not chicken?
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
People who like to test their reaction speed or take risks
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
Around 15 seconds.
</li>

</ul>
