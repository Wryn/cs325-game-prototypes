<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
Players set up turns of 3 moves that play out simultaneously. Players have a limited number of cards, 2 Swords, 2 Axes, 2 Bows, 3 Blocks, and 3 Dodges. 
<ul>
<li>Sword deals 4 Damage.</li> 
<li>Axe deals 2 Damage but isn't effected by Block.</li>
<li>Bow deals 3 Damage but isn't effected by Dodge.</li>
<li>Block reduces damage taken by 3.</li>
<li>Dodge reduces damage taken to 0.</li> 
</ul>
Click on the icon of your chosen move to queue it up. As of right now, there are no take backs. Once you have selected 3 moves, the next player will choose their moves. After both players have made their selections, their chosen moves will play out on screen, the left being Player 1's move and the right being Player 2's. The game lasts 3 rounds normally, but if after 3 rounds both players are alive with the same health, a tiebreaker round will be played.
