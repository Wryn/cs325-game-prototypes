<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
Players set up turns of 3 moves that play out simultaneously. Players have a limited number of cards, 2 Swords, 2 Axes, 2 Bows, 3 Blocks, and 3 Dodges. Click on the icon of your chosen move to queue it up. As of right now, there are no take backs. Once you have selected 3 moves, the next player will choose their moves. After both players have made their selections, their chosen moves will play out on screen, the left being Player 1's move and the right being Player 2's. The game lasts 3 rounds.
